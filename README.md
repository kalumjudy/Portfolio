This ArcGIS project aims to develop a suitability matrix based on environmental, social vulnerability index and building structures to identify potential buildings for building green roofs in Boston. The analysis is built using ArcGIS Model Builder, Spatial Analyst Tools (including Weighted and Fuzzy Overlay).
### Spatial Epidemiological Analysis on Opioid Overdose in Massachusetts

This project was a collaborative project with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH). Using the data provided by MDPH, this analysis was conducted using ArcGIS hotspot analysis (Getis Ord Gi*) tool to identify yearly opioid overdose events hotspot areas based on social-economic factors, patients' precription, emergency encounters etc. This analysis helps MDPH to allocate preventive and rehabilitative measures to areas or population that are prone to opioid overdose.
